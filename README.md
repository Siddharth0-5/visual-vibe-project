> ## "We don't just give you an answer; we create a journey."
> Instead of a boring list of text, Visual Vibe Connector transforms movie trivia into a living, explorable graph. Discover the surprising paths that link your favorite stars, powered by a high-performance backend and a delightful, interactive user interface.

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **‚ö° High-Performance Bidirectional Search:** Finds even distant connections lightning-fast by searching from both actors simultaneously and meeting in the middle.
*   **üåê Interactive Graph UI:** Powered by `vis-network`, the connection path is rendered as a dynamic, physics-based graph. Drag nodes, pan, and zoom to explore the cinematic universe.
*   **üì° Real-Time Search Feedback:** Never guess the app's status. We use **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to push live updates like *"Searching connections for Chris Evans..."* directly from the server to your screen.
*   **üîí Secure Backend Architecture:** A serverless Node.js backend protects our API keys using `.env` files. All external API calls are handled securely on the server, never exposing credentials to the client.
*   **üé¨ Details on Demand:** Click any actor or movie node in the graph to get more information, such as movie overviews, ratings, and animated GIFs, fetched on the fly.

## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

To run this project on your own machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later)
- API keys from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/visual-vibe-project.git
    cd visual-vibe-project
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables**
    - Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project.
    - Add your secret API keys to it:
      ```
      TMDB_API_KEY="YOUR_TMDB_KEY_HERE"
      GIPHY_API_KEY="YOUR_GIPHY_KEY_HERE"
      ```

4.  **Run the Development Server**
    - This project is configured for Vercel. To run it locally, install the Vercel CLI:
      ```bash
      npm i -g vercel
      ```
    - Start the local development server:
      ```bash
      vercel dev
      ```

5.  **Launch the App**
    - Open your browser and navigate to the local address provided by the Vercel CLI (usually `http://localhost:3000`).

## üèÜ Hackathon Highlights

-   **Innovation:** We went beyond a simple fetch-and-display model by implementing a complex bidirectional search algorithm and real-time server communication with SSE.
-   **User Experience:** The interactive graph and live feedback create a dynamic and engaging experience that encourages user exploration and curiosity.
-   **Technical Excellence:** The full-stack, serverless architecture demonstrates a modern, secure, and scalable approach to web development.
